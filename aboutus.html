      <h2>RE: EWC's Origin Story</h2>
        Dear EWC club members, <br><br>

        This is Sofia Covarrubias, the secretary of EWC, Empowering Women w/ Code, for the year 2021. I want to thank all of you for your interest in this coding club for young women, and for taking the time out of your day to read this letter. Within the contents of this letter, we will be discussing topics related to the origin of this club. 

        <br><br>

        <h3>Sofia's Experience</h3>
          From my own experience, I can tell you that I absolutely hated coding for the longest time. I was in a STEM program in my middle school, and I can tell you that my teachers would not give me a break. I was mostly surrounded by boys in my coding classes and was told by male teachers that if I didn't code or pursue a career in the STEM field, that I wouldn't make it in life. Obviously, if you like something and you're told "Hey, you should like doing that something...", then you aren't going to want to pursue that hobby or thing anymore. But more on that later. 
          <br><br>
          Weirdly enough, I also noticed that boys programmed very different from the girls. My male programming teacher was all about "CODE! CODE! CODE! But don't question why it works...", so obviously, I stopped taking this seriously. It wasn't until my freshman year of high school, when I met the amazing Ms. Rioux that I finally understood what made coding so beautiful. She actually taught us why code worked, went over the theory and then had us work on some example code, rather than shoving code down our throats without explanation. She made many of my officers realize that coding is more than just a way of solving problems, but instead, it also a way of expressing one's own creativity through another medium.

        <h3>Coding Experiences</h3>
        My collegues and I, and many of you, have had different experiences with coding. One of the most common themes that I have seen is that the individual started their programming journey very early in their lives, around middle school or even elementary school, which is often due to the fact that they have been privledged enough to have parents that are already in a STEM field. I have also seen those who are interested in the topic but believe that it would be nearly impossible for them to start their journey. 

        <br><br>

        For those who believe it is too late, they often think this way because they have assumed or been told that if you haven't started early enough or if you aren't Bill Gates or Einstein himself, they are not nearly as capable as those who have been put into the category of "gifted" children. 
        
        <br> <br>
        For young women particularly, I have seen them be turned off by the idea of Computer Science because of a certain stigma that surrounds the image of the programmer themselves. Most people, when they think of a programmer, think of a lanky or morbidly obese dude who has no social skills, is a neckbeard, is a nerd from those 90s to early 2000s movies, lives in their mom's basement, does nothing but study all day, and probably doesn't take a shower. However, I advise you that although there may be some truth to that statement, I want to offer a solution: join our coding club, even if you attend only one meeting and decide to never attend again. 

        <h3>New Beginnings</h3>
        My collegues and I actually came up with a vague yet similar idea revolving around the idea of creating a coding club separate from the Computer Science Honor Society and the competitive programming team, Eagle Coders, for young women particularly. We all felt as though many young women out there felt left out of this male-dominated industry, and that they would not feel accepted if they weren't as "advanced" as the others. 
        <br><br> 
        Ms. Rioux actually helped round all of us together, Audrey, Mariana, later Cadence, and I so that we could establish this girl's coding club with more clarity. We weren't set on any curriculum of some kind, but we were set on the main idea that we wanted to create a safe-place for young women (those who identify as female) and to provide mentorship for them so that they can feel included and not judged by a society of incels. 
        <br><br>
        I simply want to remind all of you young women out there that you are capable of so much, and that you shouldn't feel intimidated by the people in this industry or by the subject itself. You don't have to be the most book smart individual. All we need is determined individuals who want to grow and want to aid others in their own journeys. All it take is one meeting to change your outlook. 
        <br><br>
        Thank you for your time. 
        <br><br>
        Sincerely,
        <br><br>
        Sofia Covarrubias and the other amazing EWC officers
